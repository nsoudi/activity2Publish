<h2> One show that i havent been able to stop watching as of late is a show
    called "Castlevania"</h2>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p> Castlevania is a Netflix original animation that follows and builds upon the lore of Dracula the worlds
        most famous and powerful vampire. The thing about the show that that has kept my interest for four seasons so
        far is that the plot of the show doesn't revolve around dracula. It focuses on exploring the relationship between morality
        and humanity through amazing story telling and animation.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p> Euphoria is an HBO original drama filled show that explores the complicated lives of young adults
        maneuvering their way through the world while struggling with real world issues.
