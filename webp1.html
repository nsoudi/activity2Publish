    <p> Stephanie Beasley says "This show is amazing. As a
        longtime fan of Castlevania, even I admit that the game's storyline isn't necessarily the strongest factor but now we can enjoy it to the fullest with this show. I'm so happy they didn't pull any punches in hiring the best voice actors for the role, stayed true to the original but gorgeous art Kojima had done"

    <p> Coraei Pajaron says "Perfection. From the stellar voice casting,
        to the marvelous pacing and plot, combined with an inspired yet uniquely made story, Castlevania truly is deserving of any and every praise it gets.

    <p> Craig McQueen Says "I gave this epic 5 stars because I
        was drawn into the Castlevania world so completely plus the epic vampire fights and killings are fantastic scenes that glorify the Dracula cult of pop culture. I like the combination of new characters created here like Neville the last of the Belmonts is so full of cliches he is actually refreshingly cynical."</p>

    <p> Kenneth James says "I absolutely cannot get enough.  I
        think I must have watched it 6 times over.  The characters are sensationally well rounded.  Trevor and Sypha*, Alucard(Dracula's half human son), Issac is especially interesting.  The action is simply on a level of its own.  A good example of this would be Season 2 Episode 7.  It is incredible."</p>
