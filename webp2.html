    <p> Jaya Armstrong says "Euphoria is one of the most incredible shows I have ever seen. Truly a work of art. It was thought-provoking, awe-inspiring, thrilling, and  mind-blowing. I felt every single emotion. I was able to relate to it in so many different ways."

    <p> Anabel Waggoner says "Where to even begin? I guess I should start out by saying that this show is a complete masterpiece!
        I have seen many comments complaining about how graphic this show is, but coming from a teenage standpoint its very realistic and I could understand how it would make less teens feel alone.
        The colors and picture portrayed is breathtaking, and the characters are incredible! "</p>

    <p> Max Spratley Says "Euphoria is by far the most extraordinary representation of what it means to be a teenager in modern times. Euphoria is what 13 reasons why should’ve been, should’ve strived for. It shows a myriad of experiences and let’s itself be known that you or someone you know has experienced something this show presents.
        Whether it be drug addiction, depression, abuse, fat shaming and so on."</p>
